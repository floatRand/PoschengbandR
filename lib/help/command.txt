<style:title>Commands</style>

Commands are entered using the keyboard by pressing a single key that is mapped to an underlying command interpreted by the game. This mapping of keystrokes to game commands proceeds by using one of two standard keysets: the Original Keyset and the Roguelike Keyset. If you are playing for the first time, I recommend using the Original Keyset since it is the default and is also the most intuitive (for example, you move with the arrow keys). But there are also some crazy folks that prefer a different approach ... Just kidding. The Roguelike keyset might be more ergonomic since movement is controlled with normal alphabetic keys, but, personally, I could never train myself to switch.

Once you've chosen a game command, you may be prompted for arguments or additional information. For example, if you get hungry and decide to eat some food ('E' in the Original Keyset), the game will give you a list of choices (which might include rations of food, or various mushrooms ... whatever relevant objects you have in your pack). You can cancel the command with the ESC key.

This file contains the command mappings for the two keysets listed above. For an overview of the various commands, see <link:commdesc.txt>. Also, for beginners, there is a unified command menu that is very easy to use, and you can navigate the various commands with the cursor keys, ENTER and ESC. Each command lists the keystroke for the command, so you can explore and learn as you go. Simply press ENTER to get started (You may enable/disable this feature with the 'command_menu' option. For more on setting options, see <link:option.txt>).

Don't be overwhelmed by the sheer number of commands. Many are not often used or required, and I've tried to highlight the most common commands below. You should try to memorize those, but this is easy as most commands use a mnemonic just like the Eat command discussed above. By the way, the caret (^) character in the tables below indicates pressing the CTRL key.

<topic:CommandCounts><style:heading>Command Counts</style>

Some commands can be executed a fixed number of times by preceding them with a count. Counted commands will execute until the count expires, until you type any character, or until something significant happens, such as being attacked. Thus, a counted command doesn't work to attack another creature. While the command is being repeated, the number of times left to be repeated will flash by on the line at the left of the screen. <color:y>To give a count to a command, type 0, the repeat count, and then the command.</color>

Counted commands are very useful for searching or tunneling, as they automatically terminate on success, or if you are attacked. You may also terminate any counted command (or resting or running), by typing any character. This character is ignored, but it is safest to use a SPACE or ESCAPE which are always ignored as commands in case you type the command just after the count expires.

You can tell the game to automatically use a repeat count of 99 with commands you normally want to repeat (open, disarm, tunnel, bash, alter, etc) by setting the "always_repeat" option. For more information on setting options, see <link:option.txt>.

<topic:CommandArguments><style:heading>Command Arguments</style>

Some commands will prompt for extra information, such as a direction, an inventory or equipment item, a spell, a textual inscription, the symbol of a monster race, a sub-command, a verification, an amount of time, a quantity, a file name, or various other things. Normally you can hit return to choose the "default" response, or escape to cancel the command entirely.

Some commands will prompt for a direction. You may enter a "compass" direction using any of the "direction keys" shown above. Sometimes, you may specify that you wish to use the current "target", by pressing "t" or "5", or that you wish to select a new target, by pressing "*".

<topic:SelectingObjects><style:heading>Selecting and Inscribing Objects</style>

Many commands will also prompt for a particular object to be used. For example, the command to read a scroll will ask you which of the scrolls that you are carrying that you wish to read. In such cases, the selection is made by typing a letter of the alphabet. The prompt will indicate the possible letters, and will also allow you to type the key "*", which causes all of the available options to be described. The list of choices will also be shown in the Choice window, if you are using a windows environment and windows are turned on. Often you will be able to press "/" to select an object from your equipment instead of your inventory. Pressing space once will have the same effect as "*", and the second time will cancel the command and run the "i" or "e" command.

The particular object may be selected by an upper case or a lower case letter. If lower case is used, the selection takes place immediately. If upper case is used, then the particular option is described, and you are given the option of confirming or retracting that choice. Upper case selection is thus safer, but requires an extra key stroke. Also see the "!*" and "!x" inscriptions, below.

For many commands, you can also use "-" to select an object on the floor where you are standing. This lets you read scrolls or quaff potions, for example, off the dungeon floor without picking them up.

If you enter a number between 0 and 9, the first item engraved with "@#" where "#" is the number you entered will be selected. For example, if you have a shovel engraved with "@0" and you type "w" (for wield) and then 0, you will wield the shovel. This is very useful for macros (see below), since you can use this to select an object regardless of its location in your pack. Multiple numbers can be engraved on the same object; for example, if a sword is engraved with @1@0, then either "w1" or "w0" will wield it. Normally, you inscribe "@1@0" on your primary weapon, and "@2@0" on your digger or secondary weapon. Note that an inscription containing "@x#" will act like "@#" but only when the current "game command" is "x". Thus you can put "@z4" on a rod and "@u4" on a staff, and then use both "z4" and "u4" as desired.

Note that any object containing "!x" in its inscription, where "x" is the current "game command" will induce a verification prompt whenever that object is selected. Thus, inscribing, say, "!f!k!d" on an object will greatly reduce the odds of you losing it by accident, and inscribing "!*" on an object will allow you to be very paranoid about the object. Note that "selling" and "dropping" both use the "d" command. You can even repeat the inscription to invoke multiple verifications if you are truly paranoid. For example, having found, say, a potion of death, you might inscribe "!q!q!q!q" just to be absolutely, positively certain you don't accidently quaff the potion. And if you do, then your fingers are even fatter than mine!

While we are talking about inscriptions, there are certain object effects that can be annoying. For example, (and I hope this doesn't spoil the game for you) there are objects which randomly teleport the player away. This can be useful if you are out of other means of teleportation, but most of the time it is just plain annoying. You are prompted for the teleport, of course, but having prompts come up randomly is disturbing, and you often plow through the prompt anyway since you were in the middle of doing something else. In this case, you may inscribe "." on the object to eliminate the random teleportation.

Here is a summary of the effects of various example object inscriptions:
<style:table>
  <color:U>Inscription Effect
  =========== =====================================================</color>
      @1      Select this object whenever '1' is pressed in any cmd
     @w7      Select this object whenever '7' is pressed after 'w'
      !*      Verify using this object for all commands
      !q      Verify using this object for the 'q' command.
      !!      Notify when the item is fully recharged
      =g      Always pickup (get) this objects. Useful for ammo.
       .      Suppress prompt for random teleportation
       $      Suppress prompt for warning

<font color="#00ffff">Creating a Character

</font><font color="#ffffff">PosChengband is a role playing game, in which you, the player, control 
a character in a dangerous world of myth and magic. The most important 
decision you make on your quest to the Kill the Serpent of Chaos is 
what kind of character to play: Spell-wielding magician or sword-waving 
warrior? Stealthy rogue or muscial bard? Holy priest or evil spawn of 
chaos? The choices are myriad and the process of generating a new 
character is described in this help file, which will also serve to 
introduce you to many of the core concepts of the game.

Character creation, or birth, is controlled through a variety of 
choices. You must choose your character's race (</font><font color="#ff0000">Human</font><font color="#ffffff">, </font><font color="#ff0000">Elf</font><font color="#ffffff">, </font><font color="#ff0000">Hobbit</font><font color="#ffffff">, 
</font><font color="#ff0000">Orc</font><font color="#ffffff">, </font><font color="#ff0000">Undead</font><font color="#ffffff">, </font><font color="#ff0000">Demon</font><font color="#ffffff">, etc), your character's class (</font><font color="#ff0000">Warrior</font><font color="#ffffff">, </font><font color="#ff0000">Mage</font><font color="#ffffff">, 
</font><font color="#ff0000">Priest</font><font color="#ffffff">, </font><font color="#ff0000">Rogue</font><font color="#ffffff">, etc) and you character's personality (</font><font color="#ff0000">Mighty</font><font color="#ffffff">, </font><font color="#ff0000">Shrewd</font><font color="#ffffff">, 
</font><font color="#ff0000">Patient</font><font color="#ffffff">, etc). Each of these choices are described in the help files 
(see <a href="raceclass_contents.html"></font><font color="#00ff00">[a]</a></font><font color="#ffffff">).

You may start the entire process over at any time by pressing </font><font color="#ff8000">S </font><font color="#ffffff">at any 
prompt. Also, you can press </font><font color="#ff8000">ESC </font><font color="#ffffff">to back up to the previous option. 
Finally, you can press </font><font color="#ff8000">Q </font><font color="#ffffff">to quit at any time, but this is highly 
discouraged!

<a name="GameMode"></a></font><font color="#c00000">The Game Mode

</font><font color="#ffffff">The first prompt you get when beginning the game is to choose how you 
wish to play. If you are new to the game, then it is highly recommended 
you choose the </font><font color="#ff0000">Beginner </font><font color="#ffffff">option. With this mode, you won't be so 
overwhelmed with choices as is normally the case, allowing you to 
breeze through the birth process and quickly begin playing (and 
enjoying) this game. Once you have played a few times and wish to 
experience more that the game has to offer, including a vast wilderness 
with many diverse dungeons to explore, then you should choose the 
</font><font color="#ff0000">Normal </font><font color="#ffffff">option.

If you are truly bold, you can experiment with the </font><font color="#ff0000">Monster </font><font color="#ffffff">option which 
allows you to play as one of many different types of monster. Monsters 
don't have a class, but instead evolve into more powerful forms as they 
gain experience. They also tend to have variable body types, making the 
equipment sub-game both more fun, and more challenging.

Finally, there is a </font><font color="#ff0000">Real Life </font><font color="#ffffff">mode, for the truly obsessed. With this 
option, your sex, race and stats are rolled up automatically, just like 
in real life. You then need to choose a Class and Personality that best 
match your natural talents. There is no auto-roller and you really 
should accept and play with whatever is given to you to keep with the 
spirit of this option.

For the remainder of this document, and most of the rest of the help 
files, we will be assuming you are playing with the </font><font color="#ff0000">Normal </font><font color="#ffffff">option, 
which includes the full array of race and class choices as well as a 
vast wilderness to explore.

<a name="CharAttributes"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Character Attributes

</font><font color="#ffffff">Once you begin character generation you will be asked to choose your 
character's four primary attributes: sex, race, class and personality. 
If you have selected a spellcasting class, you will also be prompted 
for your choice of magic realm(s). Your character's sex has a minimal 
effect on game play, but some personalities are restricted to male only 
or female only. More details of attributes are found in the Races, 
Classes and Personalities section (see <a href="raceclass_contents.html"></font><font color="#00ff00">[b]</a></font><font color="#ffffff">) and the Magic System 
section (see <a href="magic_contents.html"></font><font color="#00ff00">[c]</a></font><font color="#ffffff">).

In addition to these attributes, there are several statistics which are 
used to determine your character's relative skills and abilities as 
follows:

  </font><font color="#00ffff">Primary Statistics
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Each character has six primary statistics or 'stats'. These are 
  strength, intelligence, wisdom, dexterity, constitution and charisma, 
  and they modify the abilities of the character in a variety of ways. 
  For example, strength affects your carrying capacity, the amount of 
  damage you do to a monster when you hit it and the number of blows 
  per round you get with a weapon. A more complete discussion of the 
  primary statistics is contained later in this document (see <a href="birth.html#PrimaryStats"></font><font color="#00ff00">[d]</a> 
  </font><font color="#ffffff">below).
  
  </font><font color="#00ffff">Experience
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Experience affects almost everything else about your character. 
  Experience can be gained as your character kills monsters, casts 
  spells for the first time, learns about an object kind by using it, 
  disarms traps and unlocks doors. Certain classes may also gain 
  experience by destroying specific dungeon spell books and there are 
  potions in the dungeon that will boost your experience if you quaff 
  them.
  
  When your character's experience crosses certain fixed boundaries, 
  you will attain a new experience level (up to a maximum of 50). When 
  this happens, your hitpoints, mana (if any), certain skills such as 
  melee fighting and bows and throws will all increase. Some races and 
  classes will also gain new powers and abilities when crossing certain 
  experience thresholds.
  
  Deep down inside, the real objective of the game is to increase your 
  experience, and certain other characteristics, and also to collect 
  useful items, to give you a decent chance against the dreaded </font><font color="#ff0000">Serpent 
  of Chaos</font><font color="#ffffff">. Certain monsters can "drain" your experience, and thus your 
  level, which will cause you to lose all of the effects of the higher 
  level. Luckily, you can restore drained experience through magical 
  means, or by simply regaining the experience all over again.
  
  </font><font color="#00ffff">Gold (Au)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Each character has some gold, which can be used to buy items and 
  services from the shops and other buildings on the town level. Gold 
  can be obtained by selling items to the shops, taking it from the 
  corpses of dead monsters, mining it and by finding it lying on the 
  dungeon floor.
  
  Each character starts out with some gold, the amount of which is 
  random. Each character also starts out with a few useful items, which 
  may be kept, or sold to a shop-keeper for more gold.
  
  </font><font color="#00ffff">Hit Points (HP)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Each character has hit points, representing how much damage the 
  character can sustain before he dies. Your hit points are derived 
  from your race, class, level, and constitution, and can be boosted by 
  magical means. Hit points may be regained by resting, or by a variety 
  of magical means.
  
  </font><font color="#00ffff">Spell Points (Mana)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Many characters have spell points, or mana, which represents how many 
  spells a character can cast. Your spell points (sometimes called 
  mana) are derived from your class, level, the primary spell stat of 
  your class, and the race modifier of that stat. Spell points may be 
  regained by resting, or by a few magical means.
  
  </font><font color="#00ffff">Character Skills
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Each character also has several primary skills: disarming, magic 
  devices, saving throws, stealth, searching, perception, melee and 
  bows and throws, which are derived from the character's race, class, 
  experience level, stats and their current equipment. These skills 
  have fairly obvious effects, but will be described more completely 
  below. The starting abilities of a character are based upon race and 
  class. Abilities may be adjusted by high or low stats, and may 
  increase with the level of the character (see <a href="birth.html#PrimarySkills"></font><font color="#00ff00">[e]</a> </font><font color="#ffffff">below for details).
  
  </font><font color="#00ffff">Speed
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Speed is arguably the most important attribute of any character. In 
  the beginning, you, and most monsters, will move at </font><font color="#ff0000">Normal </font><font color="#ffffff">speed. 
  However, occasionally you will see a monster that is moving very 
  fast, taking multiple actions for each of yours. That monster is </font><font color="#ff0000">Fast 
  </font><font color="#ffffff">and has quite an advantage. Indeed, were it smart, it could nip you 
  on your heels (I'm imagining one of Farmer Maggot's dogs to be 
  concrete), and then back away before you could strike! Wouldn't you 
  love to be able to do the same?
  
  To increase your player's speed, you will generally need magic, 
  either in the form of a spell or potion, or in the form of an 
  enchanted piece of equipment (such as </font><font color="#ff0000">Boots of Speed</font><font color="#ffffff">). Potions of 
  Speed will serve the early player well, and you should use them 
  liberally against foes that seem too powerful otherwise (especially 
  those pesky uniques). They are quite common. As you dive deeper, 
  increasing your speed becomes more and more important as the monsters 
  become more and more deadly. A slow player with lots of hitpoints can 
  still die without getting a single action if they are slow and their 
  opponent is fast.
  
<a name="PrimaryStats"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Primary Statistics

</font><font color="#ffffff">Each character has six primary stats (strength, intelligence, wisdom, 
dexterity, constitution, and charisma) which modify the abilities of 
the character in a variety of ways. Every stat has a numerical value, 
ranging from a minimum of 3, up to a normal maximum of 18, and even 
higher, into the percentile range, represented as </font><font color="#ff0000">18/01 </font><font color="#ffffff">through </font><font color="#ff0000">18/220</font><font color="#ffffff">, 
the maximal value which is generally displayed as </font><font color="#ff0000">18/***</font><font color="#ffffff">.

During the birth process, you will (typically) roll for your starting 
stat values. It is very important that you roll for good values in the 
key areas that your player intends to exploit. For example, if you are 
rolling up a mage, then you will want to make sure that your 
Intelligence is as high as possible. For a warrior, focus on Strength 
and Dexterity instead. You can't have it all, so you will need to 
balance good stats with bad stats.

As you play the game, your stats can be increased through magical 
means, or as a reward for accomplishing a difficult task, or as a 
reward for gaining enough experience to advance to a key level. 
Eventually, your stats will reach their internal maximum value, which 
is a value between 18/70 and 18/130 and which is randomly chosen at 
your player's birth. At this point, it will be up to your racial and 
class modifiers, and your equipment to boost your stats further up to 
the 18/*** limit.

  </font><font color="#00ffff">Strength
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Strength is critical to fighting effectively in melee combat and with 
  missile weapons. A high strength will improve your chances of getting 
  multiple blows with your melee weapon and, in addition, will 
  dramatically increase the amount of damage done with each hit. 
  Strength also has a marginal effect on your chance to hit your 
  opponent. Characters with low strength may receive penalties. 
  Strength is also useful in tunneling, bashing and in carrying heavy 
  items without being slowed down.

  </font><font color="#00ffff">Intelligence
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Intelligence affects the spellcasting abilities of mage-like 
  spellcasters (high mages, mages, warrior-mages, chaos-warriors and 
  rogues). Intelligence will affect the number of spells these classes 
  may learn each level, the number of spell points they receive and 
  their spell fail rates. These classes cannot learn spells if their 
  intelligence is 7 or lower. Also, intelligent characters are better 
  at using magic devices, picking locks and disarming traps. Finally, 
  intelligence influences how quickly all characters learn from their 
  experiences.

  </font><font color="#00ffff">Wisdom
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Wisdom affects the ability of priest-like spellcasters (priests, 
  paladins and monks) to use prayers. WIS will affect the number of 
  spells these classes may learn each level, the number of spell points 
  they receive and their spell fail rates. In addition, WIS is also 
  used to determine a Mindcrafter's ability to use his or her mental 
  powers. These classes cannot learn spells if their wisdom is 7 or 
  lower. Wise character's will have better chances of resisting magical 
  spells cast upon them by monsters. Wisdom also affects the players 
  awareness of their surroundings, granting faster or slower pseudo-id 
  and level feelings.

  </font><font color="#00ffff">Dexterity
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Dexterity is a combination of agility and quickness. A high dexterity 
  may allow a character to get multiple blows with lighter weapons, 
  thus greatly increasing his kill power, and will increase his chances 
  of hitting with any weapon and dodging blows from enemies. Dexterity 
  is also useful in picking locks, disarming traps, and protecting 
  yourself from some of the thieves that inhabit the dungeons.

  </font><font color="#00ffff">Constitution
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Constitution is a character's ability to resist damage to his body, 
  and to recover from damage received. Therefore a character with a 
  high constitution will receive more hit points and also recover them 
  faster while resting.

  </font><font color="#00ffff">Charisma
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Charisma represents a character's personality and force of will. A 
  character with a high charisma will be better able to dominate foes 
  and pets. Also, charisma is the primary stat used for determining 
  player and monster fear. A low charisma player is often frightened, 
  sometimes even to the point of paralysis! A high charisma player can 
  more easily break the morale of their foes. In this game, fear is a 
  very important and deadly component of gameplay. As such, charisma is 
  a very important stat. Finally, some classes (Bards, Sorcerers, etc) 
  use Charisma as their primary spell stat.

<a name="PrimarySkills"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Primary Skills

</font><font color="#ffffff">Characters possess some different abilities which can help them to 
survive. The starting abilities of a character are based upon race and 
class. Abilities may be adjusted by high or low stats, and may increase 
with the level of the character.

  </font><font color="#00ffff">Melee
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Melee is the ability to hit and do damage with weapons or fists. 
  Normally a character gets a single blow from any weapon, but if his 
  dexterity and strength are high enough, he may receive more blows per 
  round with lighter weapons. Strength and dexterity both modify the 
  ability to hit an opponent. This skill increases with the level of 
  the character.

  </font><font color="#00ffff">Bows and Throws
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Using ranged missile weapons (and throwing objects) is included in 
  this skill. Different stats apply to different weapons, but this 
  ability may modify the distance an object is thrown/fired, the amount 
  of damage done, and the ability to hit a creature. This skill 
  increases with the level of the character.

  </font><font color="#00ffff">Saving Throws
  </font><font color="#ffffff">A Saving Throw is the ability of a character to resist the effects of 
  a spell cast on him by another person/creature. This does not include 
  spells cast on the player by his own stupidity, such as quaffing a 
  nasty potion. This ability increases with the level of the character, 
  but then most high level creatures are better at casting spells, so 
  it tends to even out. A high wisdom also increases this ability.

  </font><font color="#00ffff">Stealth
  </font><font color="#ffffff">The ability to move silently about is very useful. Characters with 
  good stealth can usually surprise their opponents, gaining the first 
  blow. Also, creatures may fail to notice a stealthy character 
  entirely, allowing a player to avoid certain fights. This skill is 
  based entirely upon race and class, and will never improve unless 
  magically enhanced.

  </font><font color="#00ffff">Disarming
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Disarming is the ability to remove traps (safely), and includes 
  picking locks on traps and doors. A successful disarming will gain 
  the character some experience. A trap must be found before it can be 
  disarmed. Dexterity and intelligence both modify the ability to 
  disarm, and this ability increases with the level of the character.

  </font><font color="#00ffff">Magical Devices
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Using a magical device such as a wand or staff requires experience 
  and knowledge. Spell users such as magi and priests are therefore 
  much better at using a magical device than say a warrior. This skill 
  is modified by intelligence, and increases with the level of the 
  character.

  </font><font color="#00ffff">Perception (Searching Frequency)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Perception is the ability to notice something without actively 
  seeking it out. This skill is based entirely upon race and class, and 
  will never improve unless magically enhanced.

  </font><font color="#00ffff">Searching (Searching Ability)
  </font><font color="#ffffff">To search is to actively look for secret doors, floor traps, and 
  traps on chests. Rogues are the best at searching, but magi, rangers, 
  and priests are also good at it. This skill is based entirely upon 
  race and class, and will never improve unless magically enhanced.

  </font><font color="#00ffff">Infra-vision
  </font><font color="#ffffff">Infra-vision is the ability to see heat sources. Since most of the 
  dungeon is cool or cold, infra-vision will not allow the player to 
  see walls and objects. Infra-vision will allow a character to see any 
  warm-blooded creatures up to a certain distance. This ability works 
  equally well with or with out a light source. The majority of 
  monsters are cold-blooded, and will not be detected unless lit up by 
  a light source. Most non-human races have innate infra-vision 
  ability. Humans can gain infra-vision only if it is magically 
  enhanced.

<a name="Proficiency"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Proficiency Levels

</font><font color="#ffffff">In PosChengband, characters possess different proficiency levels or 
experiences for each weapon type, spells, and a few other skills. The 
starting proficiency levels and the maximum proficiency levels of a 
character are based upon class. Each proficiency level may increase 
when you practice with it, and can be checked by the 'Check various 
information' command (~).

For weapon proficiency, you need to hit monsters many times with a 
weapon of that type to practice. And your to-hit bonus of the weapon 
will increases with the proficiency level of it. The rate of increase 
is dependent upon the level of the character and the level of the 
opponents.

For spell proficiency, you need to cast the spell many times in a deep 
level of the dungeon to practice. However, simply casting the spell 
repeatedly for no purpose other than gaining experience will not work. 
Rather, the game detects this "spamming" so you really should practice 
spells out in the real world, not sequestered in some safe corner of 
the dungeon. Finally, the fail-rate and mana consumption rate of the 
spell decreases when the proficiency level increases.

The effect of the proficiency level of the Dual Wielding and the 
Martial Arts is almost same as the weapon proficiency; These will 
effect upon your to-hit bonus of dual wielding combat or bare handed 
combat.

For the proficiency level of the Riding, you need to attack in melee or 
shoot with missile weapon when riding. And your speed increases up to 
the mount's speed when the proficiency level increases. (see <a href="monster.html#Pets"></font><font color="#00ff00">[f]</a></font><font color="#ffffff">)

<a name="BirthOptions"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Birth Options

</font><font color="#ffffff">During character generation you may press '=' at any time to access the 
birth options. A more detailed description of the various birth options 
can be found in the section on the Options Page (see <a href="option.html#Birth"></font><font color="#00ff00">[g]</a></font><font color="#ffffff">). Feel free to 
ignore these options if you are new to the game. In fact, if you chose 
the </font><font color="#ff0000">Beginner </font><font color="#ffffff">startup option as suggested, then the birth options won't 
even be displayed to you (i.e., you will play with the default 
options).

Perhaps one of the most important features of the birth options is the 
ability to decide what type of town level you want. The various town 
options are discussed on the Town page (see <a href="town.html#TownLevel"></font><font color="#00ff00">[h]</a></font><font color="#ffffff">).

<a name="AutoRoller"></a></font><font color="#c00000">The Auto-Roller

</font><font color="#ffffff">The auto-roller is a quick means of generating start-up characters 
based on a set of user-selected criteria. If you choose to use the 
auto-roller, you will be presented with a column giving the maximum 
possible statistics (see <a href="birth.html#PrimaryStats"></font><font color="#00ff00">[i]</a> </font><font color="#ffffff">below) for your choice of race, class and 
personality (see <a href="raceclass_contents.html"></font><font color="#00ff00">[j]</a></font><font color="#ffffff">). Then you can specify your desired statistics 
using keypad or cursor keys. The game will score each roll of your 
stats using a point based system and only scores in the range of 20 to 
30 are accepted. So don't be too greedy in specifying you minimal 
limits. Even forcing 30 points worth of constraints is a bad idea, 
since you are unlikely to roll 8's for all the remaining unconstrained 
stats. An example of a reasonable choice is the following:

 Name       : </font><font color="#00ffff">Test
 </font><font color="#ffffff">Sex        : </font><font color="#00ffff">Male          
 </font><font color="#ffffff">Personality: </font><font color="#00ffff">Combat        
 </font><font color="#ffffff">Race       : </font><font color="#00ffff">Nibelung      
 </font><font color="#ffffff">Subrace    :
 Class      : </font><font color="#00ffff">Priest        
 </font><font color="#ffffff">Realm      : </font><font color="#00ffff">Crusade, Life       

          </font><font color="#ffffff">Make your character. ('S' Restart, 'Q' Quit, '?' Help)
          Set minimum stats.
          2/8 for Select, 4/6 for Change value, Enter for Goto next

                     Base   Rac  Cla  Per      Total  Maximum  Points
          STR :        16    +1   -1   +1  =      17      18      10
          INT :         8    -1   -3   -1  =       3      12      -3
          WIS :        15    +2   +3   -1  =   18/10   18/30       6
          DEX :        16    +0   -1   +1  =      16      17      10
          </font><font color="#ffff00">CON :        14    +2   +0   +0  =      16   18/10       3
          </font><font color="#ffffff">CHR :         8    -2   +2   +0  =       8      17      -3

                                   Accept                         </font><font color="#00ff00">23

</font><font color="#ffffff">Once you have specified your desired statistics, the computer will then 
randomly roll successive start-up characters and compare them to your 
specified criteria. Each stat is rolled as a number from 8 to 17, with 
a normal distribution, and is then immediately modified based upon the 
race, class and personality which you have chosen. The exact quantum of 
this modification can be found in the stat bonus table (see <a href="Races.html#Tables"></font><font color="#00ff00">[k]</a></font><font color="#ffffff">, <a href="Classes.html#Tables"></font><font color="#00ff00">[l]</a> 
</font><font color="#ffffff">and <a href="Personalities.html#Tables"></font><font color="#00ff00">[m]</a></font><font color="#ffffff">).

Once a character that matches or exceeds your expectations has been 
rolled, the Auto-Roller stops to ask you whether you accept or not. If 
you accept the rolled character (by pressing </font><font color="#ff8000">Enter</font><font color="#ffffff">), you will be asked 
for its name. If not, you may press </font><font color="#ff8000">r </font><font color="#ffffff">to resume rolling and searching 
for the next match or, if this is not your first match, </font><font color="#ff8000">p </font><font color="#ffffff">to return to 
the previous character which met your criteria.

Note: The statistics are not independent of each other and trying to 
maximize each one using the auto-roller will not work. A good idea is 
to specify statistics close to maximum that are critical for your class 
(for example, high wisdom for priests, intelligence for mages and 
strength and dexterity for warriors). You should set minimum acceptable 
levels for the remaining statistics rather than looking for high rolls. 
Also note that the game significantly "nerfs" the power of the 
Auto-roller relative to other variants. After 50,000 rolls the 
Auto-roller simply stops and forces you to accept the best match (if 
any) or to repick minimums. A good idea is to pick constraints on as 
few stats as possible. The more constraints, the less quality you can 
get. For example, you can ask for 2 17s, but then you probably won't 
get anything better than an 11 on a third stat. You could instead ask 
for 3 16s with fair success. For 4 stats, you could do 16, 15, 15, 15, 
or perhaps 16, 16, 15, 14 ... You can work out the possibilities, and 
the UI coloring will let you know what is likely and what is not (</font><font color="#00ff00">Green 
</font><font color="#ffffff">scores almost always work while </font><font color="#ff8000">Orange </font><font color="#ffffff">is very unlikely and </font><font color="#c00000">Red </font><font color="#ffffff">is 
impossible). For example, my above restrictions (16, 16, 15, 14) 
yielded a handful of matches, the best being the following:

</font><font color="#ffffff">If you select not to use the auto-roller, the computer will roll one 
random character at a time and then display it for you to either accept 
or reject. The 'r', 'p' and Enter keys will work as outlined above. 
Since this is a difficult game, we recommend using the auto-roller. 
However, if you are bold, you might consider playing the game in the 
</font><font color="#ff0000">Real Life </font><font color="#ffffff">mode. With this option, the game rolls up your sex, race and 
stats just once, and you must accept this, just like in real life. 
However, you are still free to choose your class and personality based 
upon your strengths and weaknesses.

<a name="QuickStart"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Quick Start

</font><font color="#ffffff">Once an existing character dies you may create a new one from the same 
savefile. If so, you will be asked whether you want to use quick start 
or not at start up. If you choose to use quick start, you get new 
character with exactly same race, class, stats, and personality as your 
last character. Since it is common to die early on, this option can 
save you the tedium of re-rolling a new character from scratch.

<a name="Name"></a></font><font color="#c00000">Your Character's Name

</font><font color="#ffffff">During the birth process, you will be asked to name your character. 
This name will be used for your savefile (unless you created this 
character inside an existing, already named savefile) and any options 
and preferences you may set. So choose your name carefully. Changing 
your name, as you may imagine, is a complicated legal process involving 
much paperwork (and a hefty fee). Should you decide to change your name 
in the future, inquire at the Mayor's office and he will direct you how 
to proceed.

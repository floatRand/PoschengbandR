<style:title>Options and Effects</style>

Most of the <color:keyword>options</color> are accessible through the <color:keypress>=</color> command, which provides an interface to the various sets of options available to the player.

In the descriptions below, each option is listed as the textual summary which is shown on the options screen, plus the internal name of the option in parenthesis, followed by a textual description of the option.

Note that the internal name of the option can be used in user pref files to force the option to a given setting (see <link:pref.txt#Options> for more info).

Various concepts are mentioned in the descriptions below, including <color:keyword>disturb</color> (cancel any running, resting, or repeated commands, which are in progress), <color:keyword>flush</color> (forget any keypresses waiting in the keypress queue, including any macros in progress), and <color:keyword>fresh</color> (dump any pending output to the screen).

<topic:Birth><style:heading>Birth options</style>

The birth options can only be accessed while creating a new character (press <color:keypress>=</color> while creating the character). There is no way to turn them off after the creation is finished!
  <indent>
<topic:easy_id><color:U>Easy Identify</color> <color:D>(easy_id)</color>
This option simplifies the identification of objects, making Identify work just like *Identify*. However, this renders many spells (such as <color:keyword>Stone Tell</color> in Nature and <color:keyword>Identify True</color> in Sorcery) and objects (such as <color:keyword>Staves of *Identify*</color>) redundant or pointless. Also, some classes (such as the Archaeologist) are designed with early access to *Identify* as a principle bonus. Enabling this option removes the advantages of these classes, making them less worthy of playing.

In addition, this birth option will also affect the early game pseudo-identification of objects. Normally, objects must be carried in your pack for some time before you become aware of their quality. The length of time is class dependent, as is the amount of information revealed through pseudo-identification (see <link:objects.txt#Pseudo-ID>). With <color:keyword>Easy Identify</color> enabled, all players will get instantaneous and full pseudo-identification of objects, making this aspect of gameplay much easier as well.

<topic:easy_lore><color:U>Easy Lore</color> <color:D>(easy_lore)</color>
With this option enabled, the player will be born with complete knowledge of monster lore, including the various attacks and nasty surprises that many monsters usually offer to the uninitiated. This is a bit of a spoiler option, but is available for those who don't enjoy learning each of the many monsters present in the game. Like the <color:U>Easy Identify</color> option, <color:U>Easy Lore</color> also renders a few aspects of the game non-functional or pointless, including the ability to <color:keyword>Probe</color> monsters to learn about them as you encounter them, and the town <color:keyword>Beastmaster Lore</color> service to learn about monsters before you see them (for a price, of course).

<topic:smart_learn><color:U>Monsters learn from their mistakes</color> <color:D>(smart_learn)</color>
Allow monsters to learn what spell attacks you are resistant to, and to use this information to choose the best attacks.

<topic:smart_cheat><color:U>Monsters exploit players weaknesses</color> <color:D>(smart_cheat)</color>
Allow monsters to know what spell attacks you are resistant to, and to use this information to choose the best attacks.

<topic:no_wilderness><color:U>Play without a wilderness</color> <color:D>(no_wilderness)</color>
This option disables the wilderness, forcing you to play with a single special town level. As a result, the only dungeon that will be available is the <color:keyword>Pits of Angband</color>. However, the town is relatively well serviced and many, if not most, of the various fixed quests will be available for your pleasure (see <link:town.txt#NoWilderness>).

<topic:ironman_shops><color:U>Stores are permanently closed</color> <color:D>(ironman_shops)</color>
This option closes all shops. Try to survive in the deeps of the dungeon without supplies from town. Your Home still functions normally, and various town services are still available.

<topic:ironman_small_levels><color:U>Always create unusually small dungeon levels</color> <color:D>(ironman_small_levels)</color>
If this option is enabled, then every level will be smaller than usual. See the 'Allow unusually small dungeon levels' option below.

<topic:ironman_downward><color:U>Disable recall and use of up stairs</color> <color:D>(ironman_downward)</color>
You are not allowed to climb upwards, or recall to town. All stairs are downstairs and every time you teleport level, you'll teleport to a deeper level.

<topic:ironman_empty_levels><color:U>Always create empty 'arena' levels</color> <color:D>(ironman_empty_levels)</color>
If this option is enabled, then every level will be empty 'arena' level. See the "Allow empty 'arena' levels" option below.

<topic:ironman_rooms><color:U>Always generate very unusual rooms</color> <color:D>(ironman_rooms)</color>
If this option is enabled, every room becomes a vault. It is unclear whether this makes the game harder or easier.

<topic:ironman_nightmare><color:U>Nightmare mode(it isn't even remotely fair!)</color> <color:D>(ironman_nightmare)</color>
If this option is enabled, all monsters become unusually powerful, and fast. And there will be various unbelievable things happening in various situations. Furthermore, at 12:00 every night, you will have a real nightmare. You need to be crazy to turn this option on!

<topic:preserve_mode><color:U>Preserve artifacts</color> <color:D>(preserve_mode)</color>
In non-preserve mode, once a fixed artifact is generated (either on the dungeon floor or in a monster drop), it will never be generated again during that game. This means that if you miss the artifact by leaving the level before you pick it up it is gone forever. On the other hand, in preserve mode this behavior is only exhibited once you have identified the artifact. It is therefor safer to leave a level before it is completely explored as any fixed artifact can be regenerated in subsequent levels.

<topic:powerup_home><color:U>Increase capacity of your home</color> <color:D>(powerup_home)</color>
If this option is enabled, the capacity of your home will be expanded to 20 pages. If not, capacity is only 2 pages.
</indent>
<topic:Input><style:heading>Input Options</style>
  <indent>
<topic:rogue_like_commands><color:U>Rogue-like commands</color> <color:D>(rogue_like_commands)</color>
Selects the <color:keyword>roguelike</color> command set which is an alternative way of mapping keystrokes to underlying game commands. (see <link:command.txt#RogueKeyset> for info).

<topic:always_pickup><color:U>Pick things up by default</color> <color:D>(always_pickup)</color>
Tells the game that walking onto an item should attempt to pick it up. Otherwise, you must use the <color:keypress>g</color> command, or the <color:keypress>-</color> command while walking. Combined with <color:keyword>carry_query_flag</color>, allows you to selectively pick up all items which you step on.

<topic:toggle_run_status><color:U>Toggle Run Status</color> <color:D>(toggle_run_status)</color>
Internally, the player walks in a direction by pressing <color:keypress>;</color> followed by the direction argument <color:keypress>(0-9)</color> and runs by pressing <color:keypress>.</color> followed by the direction argument <color:keypress>(0-9)</color> (Roguelike: Pressing <color:keypress>,</color> followed by the direction argument). Of course, this is ridiculous tedium, so the game uses keymaps to map the number keys, arrow keys, and numpad keys to the appropriate <color:keypress>;<dir></color> sequence. For all ports but Curses, the player can press <color:keypress><shift><dir></color> to run since the default preferences map this single keypress into a <color:keypress>.<dir></color> sequence. In Curses with the default keyset, the <color:keypress><shift><arrow or numpad></color> keymaps are not available ("Curses doesn't do that"), so the player is forced to manually enter the <color:keypress>.<dir></color> sequence by hand in order to run, or to play with the Roguelike keyset (see <link:command.txt#RogueKeyset>).

With the <color:keyword>toggle_run_status</color> option enabled, the internal key commands are altered from the default. The direction keys now either walk or run in the indicated direction, depending on the current status. This status is toggled by pressing <color:keypress>.</color> (Roguelike: <color:keypress>,</color>) and displayed to the user on the bottom of the screen. Thus, with this option, the player can run during dungeon exploration with a single keystroke rather than two, toggling between running and walking as needed.

<topic:carry_query_flag><color:U>Prompt before picking things up</color> <color:D>(carry_query_flag)</color>
Forces the game to ask you if you want to pick something up when you do something that would normally cause the item to be picked up.

<topic:quick_messages><color:U>Activate quick messages</color> <color:D>(quick_messages)</color>
Allows the use of any keypress as a response to the <color:B>-more-</color> prompt (useful for monster farming). Allows most keys to mean "no" to any "(y/n)" prompt.

<topic:command_menu><color:U>Enable command selection menu</color> <color:D>(command_menu)</color>
The command selection menu is a helpful tool for beginning players. By pressing <color:keypress>ENTER</color>, this option displays a menu of all available commands, which the user may drill into with the arrow keys. This makes it easier to discover the keypress required to do a specific action:
<style:screenshot>

          +----------------------------------------------------+
</style>
<topic:other_query_flag><color:U>Prompt for floor item selection</color> <color:D>(other_query_flag)</color>
Forces the game to ask you before select an item on floor.

<topic:use_old_target><color:U>Use old target by default</color> <color:D>(use_old_target)</color>
This option forces all commands which normally ask for a <color:keyword>direction</color> to use the current <color:keyword>target</color> if there is one. Use of this option can be dangerous if you target locations on the ground, unless you clear them when done. Actually, position targets now automatically clear when they are no longer valid (e.g. after a teleport). Pay attention to the character info section of your screen as it always shows your current target, whether monster or location.

<topic:auto_target><color:U>Automatically target nearest monster</color> <color:D>(auto_target)</color>
With this option enabled, every offensive spell you cast or device you use will automatically target the closest monster if there is not already a valid target selected. If you use this option, then it is highly recommended that you also enable the <color:keyword>use_old_target</color> option. That way, if you are in a situation where the automatic targeting is not what you want, you can just select a target up front before casting your spell.

<topic:always_repeat><color:U>Repeat obvious commands</color> <color:D>(always_repeat)</color>
Tells the game that when you attempt to <color:keyword>open</color> a door or chest, <color:keyword>bash</color> a door, <color:keyword>tunnel</color> through walls, or <color:keyword>disarm</color> traps or chests, that you wish to repeat the command 99 times (see <link:command.txt#CommandCounts>).

<topic:confirm_destroy><color:U>Prompt for destruction of known worthless items</color> <color:D>(confirm_destroy)</color>
Normally, no confirmation will be asked if you attempt to destroy an object which you know to be worthless. If this option is set, the Destroy command always asks for confirmation.

<topic:confirm_wear><color:U>Confirm to wear/wield known cursed items</color> <color:D>(confirm_wear)</color>
Some players may occasionally, due to a typing mistake, find themselves wearing an item which they knew was cursed. If this option is set, you should be safe from such typing mistakes: you will be prompted if you attempt to wear or wield an item if your character knows it is cursed.

<topic:confirm_quest><color:U>Prompt before exiting a quest level</color> <color:D>(confirm_quest)</color>
In the dungeon, you can freely climb up/down stairs and can return to former floors normally. But in some quest level, including the random quest, you can not return once you escaped from the level. If this option is set, the program asks for confirmation before you go up the stairs from such quest levels.

<topic:target_pet><color:U>Allow targetting pets</color> <color:D>(target_pet)</color>
Normally, the program doesn't automatically choose pets as target in the targeting mode of attack spells. If this option is set, the program always chooses every monster in sight as target.

<topic:easy_open><color:U>Automatically open doors</color> <color:D>(easy_open)</color>
Makes it easy for your character to open a door: simply by walking into it! Also the open command will automatically select one direction if only one door is near you.

<topic:easy_disarm><color:U>Automatically disarm traps</color> <color:D>(easy_disarm)</color>
Makes it easy for your character disarms a trap: simply by walking into it! Also the disarm command will automatically select one direction if only one known trap is near you.

<topic:easy_floor><color:U>Display floor stacks in a list</color> <color:D>(easy_floor)</color>
Lets you select an item from a stack on the floor by browsing a list. Also the look command will describe floor stack as "You see a stack of n items.", when there is more than one item on a floor grid, and display a list of items when you press 'x' at that time.

<topic:over_exert><color:U>Allow casting spells when short of mana</color> <color:D>(over_exert)</color>
Normally, you are prevented from casting spells when you don't have enough mana since accidentally doing so can have very nasty consequences, including death. If this option is set, then you are permitted to cast spells at such dangerous times, with a warning prompt, of course!

<topic:numpad_as_cursorkey><color:U>Use numpad keys as cursor keys in editor mode</color> <color:D>(numpad_as_cursorkey)</color>
This option makes numpad keys work as cursor movement keys while text editing mode. Which include auto-picker editor, inputing an inscription, a macro action, and etc.
</indent>
<topic:MapScreen><style:heading>Map & Screen Options</style>
  <indent>
<topic:center_player><color:U>Center map while walking</color> <color:D>(center_player)</color>
With this option enabled, the map window automatically recenters on the player as you walk. I find this rather disturbing, but it helps if you are on a small monitor and worried about off screen monsters.

<topic:center_running><color:U>Centering even while running</color> <color:D>(center_running)</color>
Normally, the map does not center on the player if the player moves with the "run" command, only when the running finishes. If this option is set, the map always centers on the player.

<topic:view_yellow_lite><color:U>Use special colors for torch-lit grids</color> <color:D>(view_yellow_lite)</color>
This option causes special colors to be used for "torch-lit" grids in certain situations (see the entries for"view_granite_lite" and "view_special_lite"). Turning this option off will slightly improve game speed.

<topic:view_bright_lite><color:U>Use special colors for 'viewable' grids</color> <color:D>(view_bright_lite)</color>
This option causes special colors to be used for non "viewable" grids in certain situations (see "view_granite_lite" and "view_special_lite"). When this option is set, floor grids which are normally drawn in "white" but which are not currently "viewable" by the player are instead drawn in "dark gray". This makes the "viewable" grids to appear "brighter" than the others, allowing the player to easily determine which floor grids are in "line of sight". Turning this option off will probably increase the speed of the game.

<topic:view_granite_lite><color:U>Use special colors for wall grids</color> <color:D>(view_granite_lite)</color>
This option activates a special color scheme for all "wall" grids which are normally drawn in "white" (as walls and rubble normally are). When the player is blind, we use "dark gray", else if the grid is torch-lit, we use "yellow" (or "white") depending on the "view_yellow_lite" option, else if the "view_bright_lite" option is set, and the grid is not in line of sight, or the grid is dark, or the grid is only "partially" lit, then we use "gray", otherwise we use the normal "white". Turning this option off will probably increase the speed of the game. This option may not work well if the attr/char codes for walls/veins have been changed.

<topic:view_special_lite><color:U>Use special colors for floor grids</color> <color:D>(view_special_lite)</color>
This option activates a special color scheme for all "floor" grids which are normally drawn in "white" (as they normally are). When the player is blind, we use "dark gray", else if the grid is torch-lit, we use "yellow" (or "white") depending on the "view_yellow_lite" option, else if the grid is "dark", we use "dark gray", else if the "view_bright_lite" option is set, and the grid is not in line of sight, we use "gray", otherwise we use the normal "white". Turning this option off will probably increase the speed of the game. This option may not work well if the attr/char codes for walls/veins have been changed

<topic:view_perma_grids><color:U>Map remembers all perma-lit grids</color> <color:D>(view_perma_grids)</color>
Memorize all perma-lit floor grids which are seen by the player. This option allows you to keep track of which explored floor grids were perma-lit, but does not distinguish between dark floor grids, unexplored floor grids, and unknown grids. Turning off this option allows the player to always know which lit floor grids are in line of sight, but this is better accomplished by the "view_bright_lite" option. Note that any non-floor grids which is seen by the player are always memorized, and "object" which is seen by the player is memorized independently from the memorization of the grid itself.

<topic:view_torch_grids><color:U>Map remembers all torch-lit grids</color> <color:D>(view_torch_grids)</color>
Memorize all (torch-lit) floor grids which are seen by the player. This option not only allows you to keep track of which floor grids have been explored, but also which ones are "dark", because the use of this option activates a special "color scheme" for the display of floor grids, in which "dark" grids are drawn in "dark gray","lit" grids are drawn in "white", and (if the "view_bright_lite" option is set) "lit" grids which are also in line of sight are drawn in "orange". Note that grids which are currently "torch-lit" are considered to be "lit", and are thus drawn in "white", unless the "view_yellow_lite" option is set, in which case they are drawn in "yellow".

<topic:view_unsafe_grids><color:U>Map marked by detect traps</color> <color:D>(view_unsafe_grids)</color>
Unknown grids that have not been traversed previously, or had a detect trap spell cast on them are marked with a grey 'x'. This allows you to determine where in the dungeon you have cast detect traps, but does not ensure that grids not marked with a grey 'x' are trap free. This option has no effect on surface grids, but outdoor locations cannot be trapped.

<topic:fresh_before><color:U>Flush output while continuous command</color> <color:D>(fresh_before)</color>
This option forces the game to flush all output before every command. This will give you maximal information, but may slow down the game somewhat. Note that this option is only useful when using macros, resting, running, or repeating commands, since the output is always flushed when the game is waiting for a keypress from the user.

<topic:fresh_after><color:U>Flush output after monster's move</color> <color:D>(fresh_after)</color>
This option forces the game to flush all output after not only every player command, but also after every round of processing monsters and objects, which will give you maximal information, but may slow down the game a lot, especially on slower machines, and on faster machines you normally do not have a chance to see the results anyway.

<topic:fresh_message><color:U>Flush output after every message</color> <color:D>(fresh_message)</color>
This option forces the game to flush all output after every message displayed by the game. This will give you maximal information, but may slow down the game somewhat.

<topic:hilite_player><color:U>Hilite the player with the cursor</color> <color:D>(hilite_player)</color>
Place the visible cursor on the player. This looks fine on some Unix machines, but horrible on most graphics machines. Note that only some machines are able to *not* show the cursor, but on those machines, hiding the cursor often speeds up the game and looks better.

<topic:display_path><color:U>Display actual path before shooting</color> <color:D>(display_path)</color>
When this option is set, the targeting mode will show path from you to current target point continuously.
</indent>
<topic:TextDisplay><style:heading>Text Display Options</style>
  <indent>
<topic:plain_descriptions><color:U>Plain object descriptions</color> <color:D>(plain_descriptions)</color>
This option disables "full" names for identified 'flavored' objects, in other words, if this option is not in use, an identified Potion of Speed could be listed (for example) as a Blue Potion of Speed. If you prefer simpler, less verbose descriptions, set this option.

<topic:always_show_list><color:U>Always show list when choosing items</color> <color:D>(always_show_list)</color>
When this option is set, all commands which lets you to choose an item from inventory or equipment list will automatically show list when activated.

<topic:depth_in_feet><color:U>Show dungeon level in feet</color> <color:D>(depth_in_feet)</color>
Display the dungeon depth in "feet" instead of as an actual level. This also affects the monster memory display.

<topic:show_labels><color:U>Show labels in object listings</color> <color:D>(show_labels)</color>
Display the labels for objects in the equipment list, and in any special window which is displaying the equipment. These labels indicate what the player is using the object for, such as "wielding" or "wearing" (in a given location). After you have played for a while, this information is no longer useful, and can be annoying.

<topic:show_weights><color:U>Show weights in object listings</color> <color:D>(show_weights)</color>
Display the weights of objects in the inventory and equipment lists, and in stores, and in any special window which is displaying any of these lists.

<topic:show_discounts><color:U>Show discounts in object listings</color> <color:D>(show_discounts)</color>
Display the discount of the object, if any, as part of its inscription. Disabling this option won't remove the object's discount. Rather, this information will no longer be displayed to the player.

<topic:show_item_graph><color:U>Show items graphics</color> <color:D>(show_item_graph)</color>
Displays small icons of the items in your inventory list, equipment list and stores.

<topic:equippy_chars><color:U>Display 'equippy' chars</color> <color:D>(equippy_chars)</color>
This option will show you a graphical representation of your worn equipment on the main screen. The 'equippy' chars will use the standard symbols of the respective items.

<topic:display_hp_bar><color:U>Display player hp bar</color> <color:D>(display_hp_bar)</color>
This option will display a status bar on the main screen that details your current health. For example:
  @[<color:y>*******</color>--]

<topic:display_sp_bar><color:U>Display player sp bar</color> <color:D>(display_sp_bar)</color>
This option will display a status bar on the main screen that details your current mana. For example:
  <color:W>?</color>[<color:r>***</color>------]

<topic:display_food_bar><color:U>Display detailed food status</color> <color:D>(display_food_bar)</color>
This option will display a status bar on the main screen that details your current state of hunger. For example:
  <color:U>,</color>[<color:R>**</color>-------]

<topic:compress_savefile><color:U>Compress messages in savefiles</color> <color:D>(compress_savefile)</color>
Compress the savefile, by only saving the most recent "messages" that the player has received. This can cut the size of the savefile by a drastic amount, but will result in the loss of message information.

<topic:abbrev_extra><color:U>Describe obj's extra resistances by abbreviation</color> <color:D>(abbrev_extra)</color>
When an *identified* equipment is displayed, an abbreviation string for the object's extra resitances and extra abilities are added as fake inscriptions of the object.

A word "EXTRA" means that the ability must not be obvious from the objects name. For example, a pair of boots of Levitation sometimes has EXTRA shard resistance. But fire resistance of an armor of Resist Fire is not an EXTRA resistance.

The list of abbreviations for each resistances and abilities are described in <link:objects.txt#InscriptionAbbrev>.

<topic:abbrev_all><color:U>Describe obj's all resistances by abbreviation</color> <color:D>(abbrev_all)</color>
When an *identified* equipment is displayed, an abbreviation string for all the object's resitances and abilities are added as fake inscriptions of the object.

The list of abbreviations for each resistances and abilities are described in <link:objects.txt#InscriptionAbbrev>.

<topic:exp_need><color:U>Show the experience needed for the next level</color> <color:D>(exp_need)</color>
Setting this option to yes alters the display of experience on the left of the main screen to the experience needed to reach the next character level, instead of the character's current total experience.

<topic:ignore_unview><color:U>Ignore actions of out of sight monsters</color> <color:D>(ignore_unview)</color>
With this option, you won't receive messages when out of sight monsters fight one another. This is useful if you are playing with lots of pets and don't wish to read a blow by blow account of the battle raging around you.

<topic:simple_stat_display><color:U>Display high stats in a more simple format</color> <color:D>(simple_stat_display)</color>
This option causes the game to display stats as numbers up to 40, instead of the percentile system where the max is 18/220. The game still works the same way under the hood, though. This only changes the way things are displayed to the player.

<topic:display_race><color:U>Player character depends on their race</color> <color:D>(simple_stat_display)</color>
With this option a player who plays as a Quylthulg, for example, will be represented by a Q. If the option is turned off the player will always be @.

<topic:GamePlay><style:heading>Game Play Options</style>
  <indent>
<topic:stack_force_notes><color:U>Merge inscriptions when stacking</color> <color:D>(stack_force_notes)</color>
Force otherwise identical objects to merge, even if one has an empty inscription and the other does not. The resulting stack keeps the non-empty inscription.

<topic:stack_force_costs><color:U>Merge discounts when stacking</color> <color:D>(stack_force_costs)</color>
Force otherwise identical objects to merge, even if they have different discounts. The resulting stack keeps the largest discount. This option may cause you to lose "value", but will give you optimal pack usage.

<topic:expand_list><color:U>Expand the power of the list commands</color> <color:D>(expand_list)</color>
Expand the "listing" commands so that they "wrap" at the "edges" of the appropriate list. This allows the "look" and "target" commands to "cycle" through all appropriate grids forever, and the "identify symbol" to browse through all of the monsters of a given type.

<topic:small_levels><color:U>Allow unusually small dungeon levels</color> <color:D>(small_levels)</color>
This option enables the creation of levels of varying sizes. Levels that are as small as the town level (i.e. 1 'screen') are possible, yet they can be dangerous, especially for a low level character. Note that this option has the side effect of enabling / disabling 'destroyed' levels (they are enabled if small levels are).

<topic:always_small_levels><color:U>Always create unusually small dungeon levels</color> <color:D>(always_small_levels)</color>
If this option is enabled, then every level will be smaller than usual. See the 'Allow unusually small dungeon levels' option above.

<topic:empty_levels><color:U>Allow empty 'arena' levels</color> <color:D>(empty_levels)</color>
Normal dungeon levels consist mostly of rock. If this option is in use, levels which have empty floor instead of solid rock may also be created (somewhat reminiscent of Nethack's "big-room" levels). These levels can be extremely deadly, especially with breathing monsters (since there are few obstructions to shield). Arena levels may have vaults, nests and pits in them like normal levels. Some arena levels are dark when they are created, but most are lit.

<topic:bound_walls_perm><color:U>Boundary walls become 'permanent wall'</color> <color:D>(bound_walls_perm)</color>
If this option is set, boundaries of dungeon floors will explicitly look like permanent walls. If unset, those will look like normal walls, but still behave as permanent walls.

<topic:last_words><color:U>Leave last words when your character dies</color> <color:D>(last_words)</color>
Display a random line from the "death.txt" file when your character dies and then allow you to rewrite these last words. If this option is not selected, the "You die." message is displayed instead.

<topic:allow_debug_opts><color:U>Allow use of debug/cheat options</color> <color:D>(allow_debug_opts)</color>
Since use of debug command(^A), wizard mode(^W), and Cheating options ('C' in options panel) mark the player as "Cheater" who can't register their score, these debug/cheat options are forbidden by default. The allow_debug_opts option removes these restrictions, and allow the player to become "Cheater". But perhaps you just want to test?
</indent>
<topic:Disturbance><style:heading>Disturbance Options</style>

<topic:find_ignore_stairs><color:U>Run past stairs</color> <color:D>(find_ignore_stairs)</color>
Ignore stairs when running.

<topic:find_ignore_doors><color:U>Run through open doors</color> <color:D>(find_ignore_doors)</color>
Ignore open doors when running.

<topic:find_cut><color:U>Run past known corners</color> <color:D>(find_cut)</color>
Cut sharply around known corners when running. This will result in faster running, but may cause you to run into a lurking monster.

<topic:check_abort><color:U>Check for user abort while continuous command</color> <color:D>(check_abort)</color>
Turning this option off will avoid checking to see if the user has pressed a key during resting or running or repeated commands. This not only makes the game much more efficient (on many systems), but also allows the use of certain obscure macro sequences, such as turning this option off, resting until done, turning this option on, and casting a spell. Resting for long periods of time with this option turned off is dangerous since the resting may not stop until the user takes damage from starvation.

<topic:flush_failure><color:U>Flush input on various failures</color> <color:D>(flush_failure)</color>
This option forces the game to flush all pending input whenever various "failures" occur, such as failure to cast a spell, failure to use a wand, etc. This is very useful if you use macros which include "directional" components with commands that can fail, since it will prevent you from walking towards monsters when your spells fail.

<topic:flush_disturb><color:U>Flush input whenever disturbed</color> <color:D>(flush_disturb)</color>
This option forces the game to flush all pending input whenever the character is "disturbed". This is useful if you use macros which take time, since it will prevent you from continuing your macro while being attacked by a monster.

<topic:disturb_move><color:U>Disturb whenever any monster moves</color> <color:D>(disturb_move)</color>
Disturb the player when any monster moves, appears, or disappears. This includes monsters which are only visible due to telepathy, so you should probably turn this option off if you want to "rest" near such monsters.

<topic:disturb_high><color:U>Disturb whenever high-level monster moves</color> <color:D>(disturb_high)</color>
Disturb the player when any monster whose level is higher than the player moves, appears, or disappears. This includes monsters which are only visible due to telepathy.

<topic:disturb_near><color:U>Disturb whenever viewable monster moves</color> <color:D>(disturb_near)</color>
Disturb the player when any viewable monster moves, whenever any monster becomes viewable for the first time, and also whenever any viewable monster becomes no longer viewable. This option ignores the existence of "telepathy" for the purpose of determining whether a monster is "viewable". See also the "view_reduce_view" option.

<topic:disturb_pets><color:U>Disturb when visible pets move</color> <color:D>(disturb_pets)</color>
The player may wish that some of the disturbance options do not apply to pets: for example, it can be annoying if your rest is always disturbed by a pet dog who pops in every now and then. By default, pets do not disturb you even if full monster disturbance options are set. If you want your pets to disturb you like normal monsters, set this option.

<topic:disturb_panel><color:U>Disturb whenever map panel changes</color> <color:D>(disturb_panel)</color>
This option causes you to be disturbed by the map scrolling, as it does automatically when you get close to the edge of the screen.

<topic:disturb_state><color:U>Disturb whenever player state changes</color> <color:D>(disturb_state)</color>
This option causes you to be disturbed whenever the player state changes, including changes in hunger, resistance, confusion, etc.

<topic:disturb_minor><color:U>Disturb whenever boring things happen</color> <color:D>(disturb_minor)</color>
This option causes you to be disturbed by various bring things, including monsters bashing down doors, inventory feelings, and beginning to run out of fuel.

<topic:ring_bell><color:U>Audible bell (on errors, etc)</color> <color:D>(ring_bell)</color>
Attempt to make a bell noise when various errors occur.

<topic:disturb_trap_detect><color:U>Disturb when leaving trap detected area</color> <color:D>(disturb_trap_detect)</color>
This option causes you to be disturbed when the player is running out of trap-detected area.

<topic:alert_trap_detect><color:U>Alert when leaving trap detected area</color> <color:D>(alert_trap_detect)</color>
This option alerts you with message when the player is moving out of the trap-detected area.
</indent>
<topic:AutoDestroyer><style:heading>Easy Auto-Destroyer Options</style>
  <indent>
<topic:destroy_items><color:U>Use easy auto-destroyer</color> <color:D>(destroy_items)</color>
This option turns The Easy Destroyer on and off. If enabled, The Easy Destroyer will destroy all objects unless the object is protected by one or more of the leave_* options discussed below.

<style:note>Note: The <color:keyword>Easy Auto-Destroyer</color> is a simpler to use version of the full featured <color:keyword>Mogaminator</color> discussed in <link:editor.txt>. It is designed for those who feel the full version is too complicated to use. However, you really should only use one or the other. So if you are using the full version, then you should not also enable the easy version.</style>

<topic:destroy_feeling><color:U>Apply auto-destroy as sense feeling</color> <color:D>(destroy_feeling)</color>
If this option is turned on, both The Mogaminator and The Easy Destroyer will take actions whenever the player senses the quality of an object (i.e., whenever pseudo-id kicks in).

<topic:destroy_identify><color:U>Apply auto-destroy as identify an item</color> <color:D>(destroy_identify)</color>
If this option is turned on, both The Mogaminator and The Easy Destroyer will take actions whenever the player identifies an object, whether with a spell or with a magical device (but, alas, not via a town service).

<topic:destroy_debug><color:U>List the rule used when applying the Mogaminator</color> <color:D>(destroy_debug)</color>
This is a debugging option when using the full-featured Mogaminator. Enabling this option results in the reporting of the rule used whenever an action is taken, such as pickup, auto-identify or destroy. The rule in question will appear in the message line. For example:<style:screenshot>
  <indent>You have 26 charges remaining. <color:B>(AutoID</color><color:B>:</color>~?<color:G>unidentified </color><color:R>rods</color><color:B>)</color> You see <color:v>a </color>
<color:v>Rod: </color><color:W>Frost Ball</color><color:v> (</color><color:y>1/3 charges</color><color:v>)</color>. <color:B>(Destroy:</color>(!<color:R>rods</color>:frost ball$<color:B>)</color>
Auto-destroying.</indent>
</style>
In addition, the matching rule will be displayed when inspecting objects. For example:<style:screenshot>
  <indent><color:o>an Amulet (Defender) [+12]</color>
  Resist <color:g>Acid</color>, <color:b>Electricity</color>, <color:r>Fire</color>, <color:W>Cold</color>, <color:G>Poison</color>
  <color:R>Free Action</color>; <color:B>See Invisible</color>; <color:B>Levitation</color>
  <color:B>It cannot be harmed by the elements.</color>
  <color:r>Autopick:</color> ~<color:G>*identified* </color><color:R>amulets</color><color:o> more value than 10000</color>
</style>
<topic:leave_worth><color:U>Auto-destroyer leaves known worthy items</color> <color:D>(leave_worth)</color>
This option protects known objects that can be sold in stores from auto-destruction by The Easy Destroyer.

<topic:leave_equip><color:U>Auto-destroyer leaves weapons and armour</color> <color:D>(leave_equip)</color>
This option protects all weapons and armour from auto-destruction by The Easy Destroyer.

<topic:leave_chest><color:U>Auto-destroyer leaves closed chests</color> <color:D>(leave_chest)</color>
This option protects all chests which are not yet opened from auto-destruction by The Easy Destroyer.

<topic:leave_wanted><color:U>Auto-destroyer leaves wanted corpses</color> <color:D>(leave_wanted)</color>
This option protects corpses of monsters wanted at the Hunter's office from auto-destruction by The Easy Destroyer.

<topic:leave_corpse><color:U>Auto-destroyer leaves corpses and skeletons</color> <color:D>(leave_corpse)</color>
This option protects all corpses and skeletons from auto-destruction by The Easy Destroyer.

<topic:leave_junk><color:U>Auto-destroyer leaves junk</color> <color:D>(leave_junk)</color>
This option protects all 'junk', such as Shards of Pottery or Broken Stick, from auto-destruction by The Easy Destroyer. This is especially helpful for Archers.

<topic:leave_special><color:U>Auto-destroyer leaves items your race/class needs</color> <color:D>(leave_special)</color>
This option protects specific items which are normally worthless, but very important for specific classes or races. These include bones for Archers, ego light sources of darkness for Ninja, Wands of Heal Monster for BeastMaster and Cavalry, and humanoid corpses for Balrogs, etc...
</indent>
<topic:BaseDelay><style:heading>Base Delay Factor</style>

The <color:keyword>delay_factor</color> value, if non-zero, is used to slow down the game, which is useful to allow you to observe the animations of bolt, beam, and ball attacks. The actual delay is equal to delay_factor cubed, in milliseconds.

<topic:Hitpoint><style:heading>Hitpoint Warning</style>

The <color:keyword>hitpoint_warn</color> value, if non-zero, is the percentage of maximal hitpoints at which the player is warned that he may die. It is also used as the cut-off for using red to display both hitpoints and mana.

<topic:Autosave><style:heading>Autosave Options</style>

Ideally, the game should be so stable that these options are not needed at all. However, even if the game were 100% reliable (which it, to be frank, probably is not), the user might forget to save and his hardware could fail him. For all of these reasons, you may want to use these options:
  <indent>
<topic:autosave_l><color:U>Autosave when entering new levels</color> <color:D>(autosave_l)</color>
If this option is set, the program will attempt to save your character every time before creating a new dungeon level.

<topic:autosave_t><color:U>Timed autosave</color> <color:D>(autosave_t)</color>
If this option is set, the program will attempt to save your character every n game turns, where n is the "frequency". To set the frequency press <color:keypress>F</color>. It will increase the frequency to the next category (and from 25000 to 0), the categories being every 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000, 10000 and 25000 turns. Note that the frequency must be higher than 0 and the "Timed autosave" set to "yes" for timed autosaves to take place.
</indent>
<topic:Window><style:heading>Window Flags</style>

These options select what kind of information is displayed in which window. Some platforms support "sub-windows", which are windows which can be used to display useful information generally available through other means. The best thing about these windows is that they are updated automatically (usually) to reflect the current state of the world. The "window options" can be used to specify what should be displayed in each window. The possible choices should be pretty obvious.
  <indent>
<color:U>Display inven/equip</color>
Display the player inventory (and sometimes the equipment). Note that you can toggle between Inventory and Equipment by pressing <color:keypress>^I</color>.

<color:U>Display equip/inven</color>
Display the player equipment (and sometimes the inventory). Note that you can toggle between Inventory and Equipment by pressing <color:keypress>^I</color>.

<color:U>Display Object List</color>
This option displays the results of the <color:keyword>Object List</color> command (<color:keypress>]</color>). For example:
<style:screenshot>
  There is 1 wanted object:
   <color:D>!</color> <color:B>a Potion of Resistance              </color> S 17 E 29

  There are 4 other objects:
   <color:W>|</color> a Two-Handed Sword (3d6)             S 18 E 30
   <color:D>\</color> a Lead-Filled Mace (3d4)             S 18 E 28
   <color:s>]</color> <color:U>a Pair of Metal Shod Boots [6]      </color> S 18 E 29
   <color:s>/</color> an Awl-Pike (1d8)                    S 19 E 29
</style>
<color:U>Display Monster List</color>
This option displays the results of the <color:keyword>Monster List</color> command (<color:keypress>[</color>). For example:
<style:screenshot>
  You are aware of 4 monsters, 4 are awake:
   <color:o>t</color> Aimless looking merchant (2 awake)
   <color:D>t</color> Agent of black market                N  9 W 54
   <color:y>t</color> Singing, happy drunk                 S 22 E 72
</style>
<color:U>Display messages</color>
Display the most recently generated messages (cf The <color:keypress>^P</color> command).

<color:U>Display overhead view</color>
Display an overhead view of the entire dungeon. This is very slow and gives the same results as the <color:keypress>M</color> command.

<color:U>Display monster recall</color>
Display a description of the most monster which has been most recently attacked, targeted, or examined in some way.

<color:U>Display object recall</color>
Display a description of the most recently selected object. Currently this only affects spellbooks and prayerbooks. This window flag may be usefully combined with others, such as "monster recall".

<color:U>Display dungeon view</color>
Display a copy of dungeon map.

<color:U>Display borg messages</color>
This window flag is currently used only by the Borg which is not currently supported in this variant.

<color:U>Display borg status</color>
This window flag is currently used only by the Borg which is not currently supported in this variant.
</indent>
<topic:Cheating><style:heading>Cheating Options</style>

Using the cheating options marks your character as "Cheater" and you won't get into the high-score list. Turning off the cheating options later does NOT allow your character to get a highscore entry, so think twice before using any cheat.
  <indent>
<topic:cheat_peek><color:U>Peek into object creation</color> <color:D>(cheat_peek)</color>
Cheaters never win. But they can peek at object creation.

<topic:cheat_hear><color:U>Peek into monster creation</color> <color:D>(cheat_hear)</color>

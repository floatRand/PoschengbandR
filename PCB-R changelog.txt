PCB-R changelog as of 10.12.2016:
 
CORE CHANGES:
* Much faster leveling, especially at the higher levels.
  Skills also level up much faster, three times as fast.
* Nexus doesn't scramble stats, siphons instead ( max 1d6+4 points ), giving saving throw after each point siphoned.
* Brands work on monk/innate attacks.
* Much, much faster identification. At 25 you get pseudo-id by default.
* Pseudo-id property on items has been replaced with automapping-property. Stones of Nature automatically gain this.
* Random artifact jewelry now generates in dungeons.
* ?Artifact and ?*Artifact create single tailored {special} items, instead of potentially granting random trash.
* Amnesia doesn't wipe map completely. Instead it rots it.
* Teleport Other works on teleport-resistant uniques, although they get similar resist-chance to others, plus additional 50% chance of outright ignoring it.
* Some uniques slightly nerfed ( ex. Gachapin )
* On no-wilderness mode, Olympians and Camelot uniques have more restrictive spawning-conditions.
* Itemization changes. Lot of useful consumeables drop earlier and more often, and perhaps are even found in shops.
* Shop changes. You can request shuffle stock for 10k, or hold item for 20k. Black market level scales with player.
* Cursed devices are uncursed alongside with equipment. You also sometimes get feeling of cursed device when using such.
* Summon Traps have energy-penalty on summoned monsters.
* More naming schemes for artifacts.
* Expanded the size of home from 240 items to 960.
 
ADDITIONS ( OPTIONS )
* Option for simple stat-display ( 3-40 ), although this was adopted to pseudo from R already.
* Two new birth options, forced runesword start and coffee-break mode ( very accelereted exp-gain and loot, no-wilderness and vanilla ironman_stairs )
* Option for showing HP in player-character in dungeon-view.
 
ADDITIONS ( CONTENT )
* Monster spell damage lore
* Three new classes, alchemist ( stores, reproduces and evaporates potions ), maledict ( wear cursed shit for bonuses, throw curses at things ) and freelancer ( start out as blank slate, purchase realms / skills / boosts by leveling ). Although I must warn that the classes are still unbalanced due to little playtesting.
* New race that gains automapping and autodetecting creatures, but can't use teleportation abilities outside of their own
* Bunch of new named artifacts.
* Two ( three ) new unique monsters
* Subclass for mystics. Trades out summoning and branded hits for various physical techniques.
